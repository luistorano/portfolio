                Hey there, I'm Luis Torano. I am an aspiring web developer. I'm still a begginer but I am very eager to learn and see what kind of sites I can build. I know there is still plenty to learn but I can't wait to expand my knowledge. Right now, I have learned HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript. My first experience with Web Development was with a website called MySpace. At the time, I had no idea I was doing basic web development. The road will be hard and bumpy but I am determined to become a full stack developer in the future.

                So far I have done a project called Run Buddy. It was built from the ground up in pure HTML and CSS. Flexbox was used to add the finishing touches. It was a very fun experience and it is also mobile accessible. You can view the site down bellow.

            <h2>Run Buddy</h2>
            <p>
                Run Buddy is a site that was made in my Coding Bootcamp. It is fairly simple but has a lot of work put into it. The image bellow is clickable and will take you to the site.

        <h2>Weather To Walk</h2>
        <p>
            Weather To Walk is the first group project that we made form scratch. We used HTML, CSS, Materialize and JavaScript. It is a pretty simple website that let's you check the weather in your area and it will tell you if it's a good time to take your dog for a walk. It was made fully responsive and we put in a lot of work and heart into it. You can click the image bellow for a live preview of the site.
